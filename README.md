# SGTaxiHeatMap
Visualize LTA's Taxi Availability Data with a heat map

## Setup
You will need to set up 2 API keys.

1. `taxi_script.js` 
   You will need to replace the tile source with your own. If you are not familiar with this, I recommend following this guide: http://leafletjs.com/examples/quick-start.html
2. `update_heat.py`
   You will need to replace the API key field with your own which can be obtained from https://developers.data.gov.sg/
